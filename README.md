Twitter Bot using Tweepy
This project is a simple Twitter bot built using the Tweepy library. The bot can search for specific keywords in tweets and like them. It can also be extended to retweet, follow users, and perform other Twitter-related actions.

Project Structure
The project contains the following key elements:

Authentication: OAuth-based authentication using Twitter API keys and access tokens.
Search and Like Tweets: The bot searches for tweets containing a specific keyword and likes them.
Error Handling: Basic error handling to avoid rate limit issues and API errors.
Future Potential: Comments in the code hint at additional features like retweeting, following users, and fetching timelines.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Tweepy
Twitter API credentials (consumer key, consumer secret, access token, access token secret)
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/RahatVortex98/twitter-bot.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd twitter-bot
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment:

For Windows:

bash
Copy code
.venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
source .venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install tweepy
Set up your Twitter API credentials:

Replace the consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, and access_token_secret with your actual Twitter API credentials in the code.
Usage
Running the bot: After setting up your Twitter credentials, you can run the bot using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python bot.py
How the bot works:

The bot searches for tweets containing the keyword 'python'.
It likes (favorite) the number of tweets defined in numbersOfTweets.
Additional Features (commented out in the code):

Fetch your own Twitter timeline using the api.user_timeline function.
Follow specific users by checking their username in your followers' list.
Easily extend the bot to retweet tweets by replacing tweet.favorite() with tweet.retweet().
Error Handling
The bot is designed to handle Twitter API rate limits using a function called limit_handler, which waits for a specified amount of time (1000 seconds) if the rate limit is exceeded.
Basic exception handling is included to catch and print API errors (using TweepError) and stop the iteration if required.
License
This project is open-source and free to use.
